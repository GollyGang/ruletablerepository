Source code for the Rule Table Repository
=========================================

http://code.google.com/p/ruletablerepository

Having defined a file format for CA rules, we need tools to read and write in it.

ruletable.h and ruletable.cpp are the class files you need to include in your
project.

read_ruletable.cpp is an example of how to read and use the ruletable class.

make-ruletable.cpp shows how to create rule table files from existing code implementations.

Compilation instructions are provided in the two example files.
