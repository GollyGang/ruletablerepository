#summary Discuss proposed changes here

== What needs to change? ==

The biggest limitation of the format at the moment is that only two update schemes are supported: the von Neumann neighborhood and the Moore neighborhood. While these are the most popular by far, a useful CA rule format must support a wide range of options. In the future we would like to support:
  * the Margolus neighborhood and other partitioning schemes
  * triangular and hexagonal lattices
  * 3-dimensional CA, 1-dimensional CA, etc.
It's not obvious how to support all of these different possibilities. XML is obviously a possibility but makes reading files harder than it need to be. Please get in touch if you have any suggestions!

To avoid bloating the format, we must be careful not to include too much. Some things we *don't* want are:
  * world specifications: size, wrap-around, etc.
  * display parameters: color, icons, etc.
These things will vary with each implementation and belong elsewhere.
