Have several of items at the top of the .table file.

n_states: 20

grid: yes

space: euclidean

sides: 4

dimentions: 2

neighborhood: Moore

symmetries: rotate4

radius: 2

A neighbourhood could then be constructed without the need for too many differnt types.

Documenting parts of patterns by selecting rectangular groups of cells and applying text to them that apear after zooming in past a 1:1 zoom as a fixed size at a fixed or relative orentation to the box, like a label. The box itself could have thin or\and subtley coloured borders.

The text for them would be stored in the RLE or MC file.

Controll click drag to create, right click them choose delete from dropdown menu to remove (or similar). I know there are coding issues with how UI is drawn atm though.

I'm not sure if this is my method or an obvious algebraic method or even if it definitely works but here goes.

It's based on something similar I did for Minesweeper that did work, inspired by something I read online about suprisingly long distance behaviour in certain Minesweeper configuations.

Start with a simple example from WireWorld.

Lets say for simplicity:

According to the rules of WireWorld this will progress as so.

As the signal travels down the wire

First create (a map?) for each state that changes.

State 1

000

100

000

.

State 2

000

000

And assign letters to each cell in each map.

All

abc

def

ghi

.

State 1

rst

uvw

xyz

.

State 2

ABC

DEF

GHI

Construct the formuli. I'm using square brackets here to represent subscript. You will need for now to view source on this to see the fomuli correctly as the Wiki has interpreted some of it and messed it up.

a[0] = 0

...

I[0] = 0

Skip a to i for this next part.

r[n] = (0 < s[n-1] + u[n-1] + v[n-1] < 3)

...

I...

Now you can rearange the equation to ask questions like for example, does this cell ever become state 1 or what are all the possiblilites for the previous generation that could lead to this one.

And specifically code could be written to do this for you.
