#summary Tells you how to use the rule tables listed, in Golly or your own program.

== Use them in Golly ==

The rule table format started with [http://golly.sourceforge.net Golly]'s need to support different CA. Golly is distributed with many of these rule tables already included, so just explore the example patterns to see them in action.

For new .tables files:
  # Save the .table file into Golly's Rules folder
  # Use {{{Control | Set Rule...}}} to change to the new rule. 

== Use them in your own programs: ==
