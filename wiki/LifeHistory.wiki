#summary Extension of HistoricalLife rule, originally by Brice Due

= Introduction =

The LifeHistory rule is a five-state superset of HistoricalLife,
allowing optional ON and OFF "marked" cells as well as history cells.
This borrows ideas and colors from Brice Due's {{{"BeforeAfterChange"}}}
rule variants from Mirek's Cellebration.

= Details =

Cell state 3 (marked ON) changes to State 4 (marked OFF = red) when
it dies, and back to State 3 if it turns on again later.  Normal ON
cells are green, as in the optimized HistoricalLife rule.  State 3 is
a slightly greenish white to differentiate it from standard colors
for two-state Life, and State 2 is a darker shade of blue than in
HistoricalLife.

Pasting standard Life or HistoricalLife patterns into a LifeHistory
universe works cleanly, and the reverse is mostly true, too -- any
marked cells are lost.  Pasting HistoricalLife or LifeHistory patterns
into a regular two-state universe is fairly painful, because State 2
or 4 cells are automatically reduced to State 1 (instead of State 0).
In these cases, the conversion scripts should be used.

Python and Perl scripts included in the [http://ruletablerepository.googlecode.com/files/LifeHistoryRules.zip LifeHistory archive file] make it easy to switch back and forth in Golly 2.0 between LifeHistory and standard two-state Life, even while a pattern is generating.  See the included readme.txt for more details.
