#summary A rule by Dave Greene, indicating the previous state of live cells

= Introduction =

HistoricalLife is an extension of Conway's Game of Life, proposed by Dave Greene. A live, cell, instead of dying, becomes a 'history' state (state 2). The state 2 cells behave identically to state 0 cells and serve as a visual map of which cells have, at one time or another, been alive. They can also be used to add labels and annotations.
