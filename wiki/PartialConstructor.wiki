#summary Explanation of partial construction

= Introduction =

Holistic self-replication is the familar concept where a machine constructs a copy of itself. More specifically, the child machine is entirely constructed by the parent machine. William R. Buckley has devised an alternative form of self-replication, where the child machine assists in its own construction.



= Details =

The parent machine constructs a seed, or 'zygote', which is itself incapable of self-replication. The zygote then 'grows' extra organs, which are dedicated to tasks such as tape-copying and rewinding. Partial construction is of interest because it more closely represents the devlopment of multi-cellular eukaryotic life. Holistic self-replication is closer to that of prokaryotes and protoctists.

Partial Construction is not restricted to formal and biological systems. Researchers at Cornell University have built a mechanical self-assembler. It doesn't actually synthesise its component parts; it merely assembles them to produce another robot. Nevertheless, it could be used as a basis for a self-replicator.

The fact that the daughter machine assists in its own construction makes it a valid partial constructor, even though it is a very trivial example of one. You can watch it in action on this [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZwTcLeelAY video].
