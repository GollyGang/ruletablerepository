#summary An idea for a symmetry to vastly simplify rule tables

= Introduction =

Many rule tables, for example Life, are much larger than necessary. There are only really 3 rules (birth/survival on 3 neighbours, survival on 2 neighbours, death otherwise), whereas the rule table is comparatively huge. One way of reducing the size of a rule table would be to allow all permutations to be handled in one line, rather than a line for each permutation.


= Details =

An example is my HistoricalLife table. It contains 85 useful rules, which are as follows:


56 permutations of 'birth or survival on 3 neighbours'
28 permutations of 'survival on 2 neighbours'
A rule to make on cells die and become history cells.


The new rules might be expressed like this:

{{{
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

f,1,1,1,a,b,c,d,e,1 interchange {N,NE,E,SE,S,SW,W,NW}
1,1,1,a,b,c,d,e,g,1 interchange {N,NE,E,SE,S,SW,W,NW}
1,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,2

}}}
