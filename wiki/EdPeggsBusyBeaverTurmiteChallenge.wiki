Ed identified 10 machines that are unresolved. Add results below as you find them:

|| `{{{1,2,0},{2,1,0},{0,4,0}}}` || Highway after 67 million steps. ||
|| `{{{1,2,0},{2,1,0},{0,8,0}}}` || Still on grid after 10 billion steps. || 
|| `{{{1,2,0},{2,1,0},{1,8,0}}}` || Still on grid after 10 billion steps. || 
|| `{{{1,2,0},{2,2,0},{1,8,0}}}` || Still on grid after 10 billion steps. || 
|| `{{{1,2,0},{2,8,0},{0,2,0}}}` || Still on grid after 10 billion steps. || 
|| `{{{1,2,0},{2,8,0},{0,8,0}}}` || Still on grid after 10 billion steps. || 
|| `{{{1,2,0},{2,8,0},{1,1,0}}}` || Still on grid after 10 billion steps. || 
|| `{{{1,4,0},{2,1,0},{0,2,0}}}` || Still on grid after 10 billion steps. || 
|| `{{{1,4,0},{2,2,0},{0,1,0}}}` || Still on grid after 10 billion steps. || 
|| `{{{1,4,0},{2,2,0},{1,1,0}}}` || Makes a binary counter at around 2.8 billion steps. Not sure after that, since a slight collision with previous structure is expected in the far future. ||
