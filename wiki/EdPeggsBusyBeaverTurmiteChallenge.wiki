Ed identified 10 machines that are unresolved. Add results below as you find them:

|| `{{{1,2,0},{2,1,0},{0,4,0}}}` || Highway after 67 million steps. ||
|| `{{{1,2,0},{2,1,0},{0,8,0}}}` || Still on grid after 10 billion steps. || 
|| `{{{1,2,0},{2,1,0},{1,8,0}}}` || Still on grid after 10 billion steps. || 
|| `{{{1,2,0},{2,2,0},{1,8,0}}}` || Still on grid after 10 billion steps. || 
|| `{{{1,2,0},{2,8,0},{0,2,0}}}` || Still on grid after 10 billion steps. || 
|| `{{{1,2,0},{2,8,0},{0,8,0}}}` || Still on grid after 10 billion steps. || 
|| `{{{1,2,0},{2,8,0},{1,1,0}}}` || Still on grid after 10 billion steps. || 
|| `{{{1,4,0},{2,1,0},{0,2,0}}}` || Still on grid after 10 billion steps. || 
|| `{{{1,4,0},{2,2,0},{0,1,0}}}` || Still on grid after 10 billion steps. || 
|| `{{{1,4,0},{2,2,0},{1,1,0}}}` || Binary counting between 2.8 billion and ~100 trillion steps but expected to be unpredictable again after that. ||

|| `{{{1,2,1},{0,8,1}},{{1,8,1},{0,1,0}}}` || Highway to the north-west after somewhere between 8,362,236,567 and 8,362,237,105 iterations. || Found by Mark Jeronimus. Slightly modified version of a rule by Georgi Gochev. ||
