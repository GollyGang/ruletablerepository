== Introduction ==

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine Turing machines] operate on an infinite tape, extending out to infinity in each direction. The tape is divided into cells, each of which can contain a symbol from a finite alphabet. The Turing machine consists of a finite state machine that moves along the tape, reading and writing symbols.

One way to generalise this simple definition is to alter the tape on which the Turing machine inhabits. Since there is only one possible one-dimensional tape, this involves moving into two dimensions. Natural choices for the grid are the square and hexagonal lattices; triangular and Penrose tilings are more exotic.

Another way to generalise the definition is to give the read-write head an orientation, so it moves either _forwards_ or does a _U-turn_ first. We're calling these machines _relative_, since their movement choices are relative to their current orientation. By contrast therefore the standard definition Turing machines are _absolute_.

The majority of this article is concerned with Turing machines on a square grid, both absolute and relative. Relative-movement 2D Turing machines are popularly known as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turmite Turmites].

== Background ==

Relative-movement Turing machines and 2D Turing machines have been investigated by many people over the years (both extensions are very obvious) but there are only a few papers:

  * Hartmanis, J. and Stearns, R. E. (1965) "On the Computational Complexity of Algorithms" Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, 117: 285-306.
    Pascal Michel [http://www.logique.jussieu.fr/~michel/ha#2d tells us] that this paper discusses 2D Turing machines. I haven't seen a copy myself.
  * [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YafIDVd1Z68C&lpg=PP1&ots=MZUbd8ijxj&dq=universal%20turing%20machine%20herken&pg=PA237#v=onepage&q=&f=false Brady, Allen H. (1995) "The Busy Beaver Game and the Meaning of Life". In: Herken, R. "The Universal Turing Machine: a half-century survey".] 
    He considered "!TurNing" machines (an independent invention of Turmites) and found 2-state 2-color machines that ran for 121 steps and printed 37 non-zero cells before halting. He did the same test on a triangular grid and found machines that took 171 steps and printed 39 non-zero cells before halting. He found a 3-state 2-color triangular grid machine that took 1721 steps and printed 351 non-zero cells before halting but the search was limited to 2,000 iterations.
  * Wolfram, S. (2002) "A New Kind of Science" 
    He has [http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/section-5.3 a section on 2D Turing machines].

== Make your own Turmites ==

*Absolute movement*

  * Run Scripts/Python/Rule-Generators/AbsoluteTurmite-gen.py in [http://golly.sourceforge.net Golly]. Copy-paste one of the absolute-movement specification strings, e.g.: `{{{1,'E',1},{1,'W',1}},{{1,'W',0},{1,'',0}}}`
  * Each machine is specified as a table of n_states rows by n_colors columns, written in (Western) reading order: the first row first, then then other rows. 
  * Each triple is {A,B,C} where A is the new color to write: `[0,1,2,...,(n_colors-1)]`, B is the direction to move in (North, South, East, West) or empty to halt, C is the new state to adopt: `[0,1,2,...,(n_states-1)]`.
  * For example, the triple `{1,'S',3}` means: print a '1', move South, and adopt state 3.

*Relative movement*

  * Run Scripts/Python/Rule-Generators/Turmite-gen.py in [http://golly.sourceforge.net Golly] and copy-paste one of the relative-movement specification strings below into the text box. E.g. `{{{1,2,0},{0,8,0}}}`
  * It uses a similar notation as the other script. The difference is in how the direction is specified: 1=forward, 2=right, 4=u-turn, 8=left, 0=halt. (This notation allows turmites to split, e.g. 10=turn left _and_ right.)
  * For example, the triple `{1,2,3}` means: print a '1', turn right (and move forward), and adopt state 3.

== Busy Beavers ==

This is a list of the best known [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver busy beavers]. If you find improvements then overwrite the below.

=== Summary ===

  # Going from absolute movement to relative movement improves the score. The only exception found is Sigma_relative(2,2)=4 which is the same as Sigma_absolute(2,2).
  # Going from 1D to 2D seems to improve the score other than for low numbers of state or colors.
  # No examples are known where going from 2D to 3D improves the score but this is likely to be true for higher numbers of states and colors for the same reason that the 2D case outperforms the 1D case.

=== Searching for new champions ===

To find busy beavers you'll need a search program. Here's the one I was using to find some the results listed below: [http://code.google.com/p/terminatingturmites/ Terminating Turmites]

For other programs, the wikipedia page on busy beavers will guide you.

=== Open Problems ===

  * What acceleration techniques can we find in 2D and higher? Heiner Marxen's macro machines can't obviously be used but can maybe be adapted?
  http://www.drb.insel.de/~heiner/BB/mabu90.html

  http://www.drb.insel.de/~heiner/BB/macro.html

  * So far no 3D or higher TM has been found that outperforms a 2D one with the same parameters. Do they exist or is 2D somehow special?

  * Can we understand anything about how BBs work or are they 'black boxes'? Some 1D machines (Surprise in a box) appear to have counting components - is there a similar mechanism in 2D?

And thinking about it, it will be true in all higher dimensions too - there are only 3 moves to be specified so if the 2D case is no improvement over the 1D case then adding further dimensions won't help either. Busy Beavers need to go over their own tracks to really be effective - and from this perspective it's really a surprise that some of the 2D cases outperform the 1D cases. TJH March 2010 ||

=== Beyond ===

For more states and colors, the Busy Beavers are enormous. 

For example, here are two example 3,3 Turing machines, neither of which are record holders:

`{{{1,'N',1},{2,'S',2},{2,'S',1}},{{1,'W',2},{1,'N',1},{1,'',0}},{{1,'E',0},{0,'N',0},{0,'N',0}}}`<br>
9304 steps.<br>
`{{{2,'W',1},{1,'',0},{2,'E',1}},{{2,'W',2},{0,'E',1},{2,'S',1}},{{1,'E',0},{0,'N',0},{0,'N',0}}}`<br>
697 non-zero cells written.

These are just examples - the actual record holders will have to be at least as large as the 1D case for which the record is _[http://www.cse.unr.edu/~al/BusyBeaver.html large]_:<br>
`{{{1,'E',1},{2,'W',0},{1,'W',2}},{{0,'W',0},{2,'E',1},{1,'W',1}},{{1,'',0},{1,'E',0},{1,'E',2}}}`<br>
(119,112,334,170,342,540 steps, 374,676,383 non-zero cells written)

Here's the 3,3 1D machine described as [http://www.cse.unr.edu/~al/busybeaversurprise.html Surprise-In-A-Box]:<br>
`{{{1,'E',1},{2,'W',1},{1,'W',2}},{{1,'W',0},{2,'E',1},{1,'E',1}},{{0,'',0},{2,'W',0},{0,'W',2}}}`<br>

=== Moore Turmites ===

On a square grid we could also consider turmites that move to a cell within its Moore neighborhood rather than its von Neumann neighborhood. Relative-movement Moore turmites would turn through multiples of 45 degrees.

Note that hexagonal turmites (below) can be viewed as intermediate between von Neumann turmites and Moore turmites, the three cases having 4, 6 and 8 turns/moves to make, respectively.

We haven't investigated Moore turmites yet.

----

=== Triangular Turmites ===

On a 2D grid of triangular cells, it doesn't make sense to talk about absolute-movement turmites because the triangles aren't all the same way up. Relative-movement turmites on a triangular grid were first studied by Allen H. Brady (ref at the top), and we've added some results of our own.

Each triple is {A,B,C} where A is the new color to write: [0,n_colors), B is the direction to turn: {0=halt, 1=left, 2=right, 4=u-turn}, C is the new state to adopt: [0,n_states). For example, the triple `{1,2,3}` means: print a '1', turn right, and adopt state 3.

Note that absolute-movement hexagonal-celled Turing machines can simulate any square grid machine, so their scores can never be lower. But their improvements (where there are any) are surprisingly small in the cases examined.

The 2-state 2-color results (54, 24) are significantly smaller than the square-grid (121, 37) and triangular-grid (171, 39) results, which is perhaps surprising since there are more ways for the turmites to turn (6 as opposed to 4 or 3). But then again they can only make 3 turns so maybe it's like the 3D case (above) - they don't have enough moves to take advantage of the grid. But the 3-state 2-color steps result (S=57,867) is far ahead of the square-grid (S=21,790) and triangular-grid result (S=4,499).

=== Penrose turmites ===

Turmites on Penrose tilings are especially interesting. Due to the aperiodicity of the tiling, an infinite amount of information can be stored in the initial location of the Turmite. This means that it is possible to engineer a Universal Turmite, where the program is encoded entirely in its initial position, and not in the initial contents of the tape.

However, since the time to halt depends on the position of the Turmite, there is no analogue of the Busy Beaver problem; with a sufficient number of states, a Turmite could take arbitrarily long to halt.

=== Extinction turmites ===

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Pegg,_Jr. Ed Pegg, Jr.] [http://www.mathpuzzle.com/26Mar03.html extended] the turmite idea by allowing turmites to turn _both_ left and right, for example. When turmites collide they annihilate each other. Another form of the busy beaver game is therefore to find turmites that go extinct after writing the most non-zero cells or taking the most steps.

*Relative movement, square grid*

These turmites take advantage of the notation 1=forward, 4=u-turn, 2=right, 8=left, 0=halt. To turn in two or more directions, simply add the values together. E.g. 10=turn left and right.

No-one has investigated extinction turmites on these cases, so there's lots left to be discovered.

=== Non-halting Busy Beavers ===

(Asked by Ed Pegg, Jr.)

If we consider turmites _without_ a halting state then there is still an interesting question: 
  * What turmite runs the longest before becoming predictable?

We'll collect results here. Let us know what you find.

As far as we know these are the current record holders:

*1-state 2-color relative movement:*<br>
`{{{1,2,0},{0,8,0}}}`<br>
Langton's Ant: 10,000 steps before making a highway.

*2-state 2-color relative movement:*<br>
`{{{1,4,1},{1,1,0}},{{1,1,0},{0,2,1}}}` <br> 18.22 million timesteps before making a highway: <br>

*3-state 2-color absolute movement:*<br>
`{{{0,'S',1},{1,'W',1}},{{1,'E',2},{1,'S',2}},{{1,'W',0},{0,'N',0}}}` <br>
("Perfectionist": 15.5 million timesteps before making a highway)

== Searching for high entropy patterns ==

Wolfram says this of 2D Turing machines:

  _"For Turing machines with two or three possible states, only repetitive and nested behavior normally seem to occur. With four states, more complex behavior is possible, but it is still rather rare."_ [http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/page-184 (NKS, p.184)]
 
However there _are_ examples of complex 3-state 2-color 2D Turing machines. These below were located by a program searching for patterns with high [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_%28information_theory%29 entropy]:


This pattern is seemingly random for 15.5 million timesteps, before making a repetitive highway:

`{{{0,'S',1},{1,'W',1}},{{1,'E',2},{1,'S',2}},{{1,'W',0},{0,'N',0}}}`<br> (Patterns/Turmites/Perfectionist.rle in Golly)



This pattern expands at a logarithmic rate, and behaves quite unusually:

`{{{0,'N',2},{1,'S',1}},{{0,'E',0},{0,'S',0}},{{1,'W',1},{1,'N',2}}}`<br>

This pattern grows extremely slowly, so is perhaps doing some form of counting, but appears random. Here's an animation of the states progressing from 1E9 timesteps up to 100E9 timesteps (100 frames, each 1 billion timesteps):<br>

http://ruletablerepository.googlecode.com/files/AlienCounter.gif

This resembles a form of binary counter. However, it is not performing traditional binary counting, as long strings of '1' symbols are replaced with alternating '1's and '0's, instead of solid '0's. If the counter didn't produce extra lines, and just worked in one dimension, it would count like so:

{{{

1
01
11
101
011
111
0101
1101
1011
0111
1111
10101
01101
11101
01011
11011
10111
01111
11111
010101

}}}

Notice that there is 1 one-digit number, 2 two-digit numbers, 3 three-digit numbers, 5 four-digit numbers and 8 five-digit numbers. These correspond to the Fibonacci numbers, which means that it effectively counts in base-phi, where phi is the golden number. This is quite unexpected, as phi is an irrational number, so doesn't usually occur as the base for discrete counting.

However, occasionally a parallel side-branch is created. This makes the counting process less regular, as the branches interfere with each other.
