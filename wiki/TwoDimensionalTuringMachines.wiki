== Busy Beavers ==

If you know of any research into 2D Busy Beavers, please add it here. (There must be _some_ out there! All 2D Turing machines can be simulated by 1D machines, of course, but only by using more states and/or colors.)

This is a list of the best known busy beavers. If you find improvements then overwrite the below:

=== 2-state 2-color: ===
`{{{1,'S',1},{1,'N',1}},{{1,'N',0},{1,'',1}}}`<br>
6 steps, 4 non-zero cells written.

This is the same as the 1D Busy Beaver.

=== 3-state 2-color: ===
`{{{1,'S',1},{1,'W',2}},{{0,'W',2},{0,'E',1}},{{1,'N',0},{1,'',1}}}`<br>
32 steps.<br>
`{{{1,'W',2},{1,'E',1}},{{1,'S',0},{1,'N',1}},{{1,'N',1},{1,'',1}}}`<br>
11 non-zero cells written.

(Final result from exhaustive search, unless I had bugs.)

Notice that these values are _higher_ than the best 1D Busy Beavers for these parameters: 21 steps, 6 non-zero cells. Is this true in general? (Obviously the n-dimensional values can never be lower than the (n-1)-dimensional values since the lower-dimensional turmite can always be embedded in the higher-dimensional space.)

=== 2-state 3-color: ===
`{{{1,'S',1},{2,'N',1},{1,'',0}},{{2,'N',0},{2,'S',1},{1,'N',1}}}`<br>
38 steps.<br>
`{{{1,'N',1},{2,'W',1},{0,'E',0}},{{1,'S',0},{2,'N',1},{1,'',1}}}`<br>
10 non-zero cells written.

Notice that the 38 steps case is a 1D machine. However the 10 cells written case beats the 1D case (6 cells written).

(Final result from exhaustive search, unless I had bugs.)

=== 3-state 3-color: ===
`{{{1,'N',1},{2,'S',2},{2,'S',1}},{{1,'W',2},{1,'N',1},{1,'',0}},{{1,'E',0},{0,'N',0},{0,'N',0}}}`<br>
9304 steps.<br>
`{{{2,'W',1},{1,'',0},{2,'E',1}},{{2,'W',2},{0,'E',1},{2,'S',1}},{{1,'E',0},{0,'N',0},{0,'N',0}}}`<br>
697 non-zero cells written.

These are just examples - the actual record holders will have to be at least as large as the 1D case which is [http://www.cse.unr.edu/~al/BusyBeaver.html _large_].

=== 4-state 2-color: ===
`{{{0,'S',2},{1,'N',3}},{{1,'W',3},{1,'S',1}},{{1,'S',1},{1,'',0}},{{0,'E',0},{0,'N',0}}}`<br>
3271 steps.<br>
`{{{1,'W',2},{1,'E',0}},{{1,'E',0},{1,'',0}},{{1,'N',3},{0,'S',0}},{{1,'N',1},{0,'N',0}}}`<br>
154 non-zero cells written.

Again these are just preliminary results but already far ahead of the 1D case (107 steps, 13 non-zero cells).

== Searching for high entropy patterns ==

Wolfram says this of 2D Turing machines:

  _"For Turing machines with two or three possible states, only repetitive and nested behavior normally seem to occur. With four states, more complex behavior is possible, but it is still rather rare."_ [http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/page-184 (NKS, p.184)]
 
However there _are_ examples of complex 3-state 2-color 2D Turing machines. These below were located by a program searching for patterns with high [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_%28information_theory%29 entropy]:

`{{{0,'S',1},{1,'W',1}},{{1,'E',2},{1,'S',2}},{{1,'W',0},{0,'N',0}}}`<br>
This pattern is seemingly random for 15.5 million timesteps, before making a repetitive highway.

`{{{0,'N',2},{1,'S',1}},{{0,'E',0},{0,'S',0}},{{1,'W',1},{1,'N',2}}}`<br>
This pattern grows extremely slowly, so is perhaps doing some form of counting, but appears random. Here's an animation of the states progressing from 1E9 timesteps up to 100E9 timesteps (100 frames, each 1 billion timesteps):<br>

http://ruletablerepository.googlecode.com/files/AlienCounter.gif

The pattern expands at a logarithmic rate, and resembles a binary counter. However, it is not performing traditional binary counting, as long strings of '1' symbols are replaced with alternating '1's and '0's, instead of solid '0's. If the counter didn't produce extra lines, and just worked in one dimension, it would count like so:

{{{

1
01
11
101
011
111
0101
1101
1011
0111
1111
10101
01101
11101
01011
11011
10111
01111
11111
010101

}}}

Notice that there is 1 one-digit number, 2 two-digit numbers, 3 three-digit numbers, 5 four-digit numbers and 8 five-digit numbers. These correspond to the Fibonacci numbers, which means that it effectively counts in base-phi, where phi is the golden number. This is quite unexpected, as phi is an irrational number, so doesn't usually occur as the base for discrete counting.

However, occasionally a parallel side-branch is created. This makes the counting process less regular, as the branches interfere with each other.

colors: 0=white, 1=grey<br>
(a): `{{{1,'S',1},{0,'W',2}},{{1,'S',2},{1,'E',1}},{{1,'N',3},{0,'S',0}},{{0,'E',1},{0,'N',0}}}`<br>
(b): `{{{1,'E',3},{0,'N',0}},{{1,'W',2},{1,'S',1}},{{0,'N',0},{1,'S',1}},{{1,'E',1},{0,'S',0}}}`<br>
(c): `{{{1,'W',1},{0,'E',2}},{{0,'E',3},{1,'W',0}},{{0,'N',0},{0,'S',3}},{{1,'S',0},{1,'N',1}}}`<br>
(d): `{{{0,'E',3},{0,'W',1}},{{1,'N',0},{1,'N',3}},{{0,'W',1},{1,'S',2}},{{1,'S',2},{0,'E',1}}}`<br>
(e): `{{{1,'N',1},{0,'S',1}},{{1,'S',3},{0,'N',2}},{{1,'W',0},{1,'N',1}},{{1,'S',2},{0,'E',1}}}`

Wolfram devotes [http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/page-186 a page] to example (e)
and [http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/page-184 describes it] as: "one example where the behavior seems in many respects completely random." In fact, as I reported [http://forum.wolframscience.com/showthread.php?s=86e914a0e833e3ad447abfd576c8d0a8&threadid=1749 here] the pattern is periodic, with period 2,074,575 and dx=3953, dy=1912.
